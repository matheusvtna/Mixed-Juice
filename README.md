# Mixed-Juice - WWDC21 Scholarship Application [[Accepted]](https://github.com/wwdc/2021) 

This playground was created for [WWDC 2021 Scholarship Application](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/swift-student-challenge/).

## Project
In Mixed Juice, the user meets Chef Leo: the best juice maker in the world and who has secret recipes. In the Chef's Kitchen, the player has eight attempts to guess an unknown recipe using four fruits (but not necessarily all of them), where the order of the fruits interferes with the result. With each attempt, Chef Leo's magic blender will tell you how close the chosen recipe is to the correct recipe. If the player can guess the recipe in less than eight attempts, he is the winner and with the recipe in hand. Otherwise, the Chef reveals the secret recipe, giving the player the chance to unravel another completely different and unknown recipe.

## Development
I developed this game so that the player could exercise the brain in a quick and fun way, bringing some difficulty in terms of logical reasoning.
If you want to know more about my creation process, involving ideation, design and game programming, I'll post here an article on Medium (in Portuguese), where I better describe my entire development process and talk about working on this project.
